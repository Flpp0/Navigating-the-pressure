\section {Introduction}
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a critical public health issue that frequently leads to long-term disabilities or death. After a TBI, the brain’s ability to regulate itself can be significantly compromised, resulting in a cascade of physiological disruptions. One of the most important of these is impaired autoregulation, which leads to instability in intracranial pressure (ICP) and compromised cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Consequently, cerebral blood flow can be reduced, increasing the risk of \textit{secondary brain injury} through ischemia, hypoxia, and further swelling.

The primary aim of treatment is to prevent secondary brain injury. This concept relies on distinguishing between injured brain tissue and salvageable brain tissue. While one portion of the brain may be irreversibly damaged, other areas remain viable but at risk due to inadequate blood flow or rising ICP. Failure to manage these can worsen the damage in these vulnerable regions, ultimately exacerbating the overall brain injury.\\

Dysnatriemias have already been recognized as a marker of severity of disease and related to mortality in the critically ill patient. There is however accumulating evidence that even mild abnormalities of serum sodium could be linked to disease severity and mortality, including changes within the normal range\cite{sakrFluctuationsSerumSodium2013}.

Serum sodium levels are tightly regulated in the human body, but patients with TBI are at higher risk of developing dysnatremias due to various factors such as hyperosmolar therapy, diabetes insipidus and SIADH. Both hypernatremia\cite{maggioreRelationIncidenceHypernatremia2009a}\cite{vedantamMorbidityMortalityAssociated2017a} and hyponatremia \cite{yumotoPrevalenceRiskFactors2015a} have been linked to higher mortality rates and worse outcomes in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients as well as in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH)\cite{labibSodiumItsImpact2024}\cite{balesEffectHyponatremiaSodium2016}, highlighting the importance of sodium regulation as a key therapeutic goal for individuals with elevated intracranial pressure. While managing serum sodium levels is important, fluctuations in sodium concentration, rather than just the absolute levels, may also  contribute to injury.\\

We therefore investigate the relationship between fluctuations in plasma sodium (deltaNa) and intracranial pressure (deltaICP) to evaluate how sodium variability influences ICP dynamics. Fluctuations are represented as time patients spent with sodium and ICP levels above or below predefined thresholds — referred to as Na Dose and ICP Dose — as well as  fluctuations within physiologic range.\\

\section {Materials and methods}
\subsection{Study population}
The cohort of critically ill patients with TBI was enrolled from a subpart of the Margherita3 electronic health record database - developed by the Italian Group for the Evaluation of Interventions in Intensive Care Medicine\cite{finazziDataCollectionResearch2018} - which contains the comprehensive clinical data of 5730\textcolor{red}{CONTROLLARE NUMERO PAZIENTI} patients of about 70 italian intensive care units (ICUs) between \textcolor{red}{AGGIUNGERE LE DATE}. 

The patients were searched based on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) code. The inclusion criteria identified 411 \textcolor{red}{CONTROLLARE NUMERO PAZIENTI} patients who were diagnosed with TBI.\\

\textcolor{blue}{4 e 5 di inclusion e 4 e 5 di esclusion sono la stessa cosa. Per il discorso exclusion abbiamo rimosso pazienti sia in quanto non avevano una numerosità sufficiente per interpolazione sia se non avevano una intersezione tra le due curve (sodio e IPC) di almeno 48h. Per admission criteria si potrebbe mettere direttamente il numero di valori Na e ICP senza mettere che ne abbiano almeno uno e poi mettere anche almeno x valori.
Discorso intersezione e valori minimi è per la parte di doseNa dosePIC e deltadelta.}

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age $\geq$ 18 years, (2) TBI as cause of admission, (3) at least an intracranial pressure (ICP) reading, (4) at least a plasma sodium value.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) expected ICU admission patients, (2) ICU admission after elective surgery, (3) ICU stay of less than 72h (20 patients), (4) <1 ICP measurement available , (5) <1 sodium measurement. Patients who died within 72 hours of ICU admission were excluded to focus the analysis on those with potentially salvageable brain injuries.

\subsection{Data Collection}
\textcolor{red}{FIL CONTROLLIAMOLI ASSIEME}

\textcolor{blue}{Non so nemmeno se valga la pena scrivere di Python e SQL ahah sincero :)}
Baseline parameters within the first day after ICU admission were collected using Python as  Structure Query Language (SQL) parser, including demographics (e.g., sex, age, weight, admission type), comorbidities (e.g., myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, and renal disease), assessment scale scores (Glasgow Coma Scale, GCS and Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation, APACHE II Scoring System), \textcolor{blue}{DAVVERIO ABBIAMO MESSO ANCHE QUESTI (vital signs)??} vital signs (e.g., heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, intracranial pressure and pupil reactivity). 
We gathered all serum sodium measurements from ICU admission up to 14 days, or until death, whichever occurred first. Additionally, we recorded data on various therapies, including extraventricular drainage, use of osmotherapy, barbiturate coma, hypothermia, among others. Lastly, we collected outcome data such as 14-day ICU mortality and overall ICU mortality.

\subsection{Generation of Variables and Definitions}

\paragraph{Serum Sodium Concentration on Admission}

Serum sodium concentration on admission was defined as the first available sodium measurement after admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Hyponatremia and hypernatremia were defined as conditions where at least three consecutive serum sodium values were below 135~mmol/L or above 145~mmol/L, respectively. The \textit{Na Dose} was defined as the area under the curve (AUC) where plasma sodium remains below (for hyponatremia) or above (for hypernatremia) the respective thresholds over time. This metric quantifies the extent and duration of sodium abnormalities, providing a cumulative measure of sodium imbalance.

\paragraph{Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)}

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission was defined as the first available GCS score after admission to the ICU, with a specific focus on the motor component (GCSm). Additionally, we evaluated the best and worst GCS scores within the first 24~hours to assess the patient's neurological status over time. These measurements are critical for prognostication and monitoring of patients with neurological injuries.

\paragraph{Intracranial Pressure (ICP) Dose and Plasma Sodium (Na) Dose}
The \textit{ICP Dose} is defined as the area under the curve (AUC) where intracranial pressure (ICP) exceeds 22 mmHg, a threshold linked to worse outcomes in traumatic brain injury. It quantifies the combined magnitude and duration of elevated ICP, offering a measure of intracranial hypertension severity.

The \textit{Na Dose} is the AUC where plasma sodium (Na) levels are outside the normal range: below 135 mmol/L (hyponatremia) or above 145 mmol/L (hypernatremia). It captures the extent and duration of sodium imbalance, providing insight into the severity of electrolyte disturbances and their potential impact on patient outcomes.


\paragraph{Analysis of Plasma Sodium and ICP Fluctuations}

\textcolor{blue}{Mi serve un modo per introdurre il discore del delta delta altrimenti si fa fatica a presentare la procedura che abbiamo implementato}.
The aim of this analysis is to validate that the ratio of changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) to changes in plasma sodium (Na), denoted as \(\frac{\Delta \text{ICP}}{\Delta \text{Na}}\), contains critical information that can predict patient outcomes. By demonstrating the relevance of this metric, we highlight its potential importance for clinical decision-making in the ICU, where timely and accurate adjustments to treatment plans can significantly impact patient recovery.

\textcolor{blue}{Da qui si comincia}
\textcolor{blue}{DEVO INTRODURRE IL CONCETTO DEL DELTA che è diverso dal concetto di tau. Dobbiamo parlare un attimo di questo. }
To achieve this, we first generated continuous curves for both Na and ICP using linear interpolation. For Na, linear interpolation was applied between the first and last available sodium concentration values, generating interpolated values at one-minute intervals across the entire timeframe. The same interpolation process was applied to the ICP data, resulting in a continuous curve of ICP values at one-minute intervals. This step ensures a consistent temporal resolution for both variables, enabling a detailed analysis of their fluctuations.

Next, we focused on the overlapping time periods where both Na and ICP curves had data points available. To accurately capture the temporal relationship between changes in Na and subsequent changes in ICP, it is essential to align these time-series data correctly. The concept of $\tau$ is crucial in this context: it represents the time delay between a change in Na (cause) and its resulting effect on ICP (effect). For instance, if we consider time points $T_0$ and $T_1$ for Na, and the same time points for ICP, it would be incorrect to directly correlate these changes without accounting for the time it takes for a change in Na to affect ICP. Therefore, we need to align the curves by shifting the ICP curve backward by $\tau$ minutes relative to the Na curve.

\textcolor{blue}{Da aggiungere che questa procedura ha senso perché clinicamente è accettato che Na influenza PIC e in più abbiamo validato questa con il metodo della Granger Causality: nel 60\% dei casi risultato statisticamente valido. Bisogna scriverlo meglio secondo me.}

To determine the optimal $\tau$, we initially employed Granger causality analysis, a statistical method that assesses whether past values of one time series can predict future values of another. This step served to confirm the well-established directional relationship where changes in Na levels influence subsequent changes in ICP (Na $\rightarrow$ ICP) as documented in the literature. However, while Granger causality validated the direction of influence, it \textit{did not provide a statistically significant universal value for} $\tau$ across the patient population. This finding indicated that a fixed $\tau$ could not adequately describe the relationship for all patients.

Given this limitation, we adopted an empirical approach using a grid search to identify the optimal $\tau$ for each patient. The grid search involved testing various $\tau$ values within a plausible range based on clinical knowledge and previous studies \textcolor{blue}{Ti va se mettiamo proprio i valori?} For each $\tau$ value tested, the Na and ICP curves were aligned accordingly, and we evaluated which alignment produced a dataset that resulted in the best performance of downstream machine learning (ML) models. This data-driven method allowed us to select the most appropriate $\tau$ for each patient, taking into account individual variability in the time delay between changes in Na and their effects on ICP.

By selecting the $\tau$ that maximized the predictive accuracy of the ML models, we ensured that the time-series alignment was optimized for subsequent analysis. This iterative optimization provided a tailored approach for each patient, enhancing the reliability of the calculated \(\frac{\Delta \text{ICP}}{\Delta \text{Na}}\) values and their use in predicting patient outcomes.

In summary, the procedure involved generating interpolated time-series data for Na and ICP, confirming the Na $\rightarrow$ ICP relationship with Granger causality, and using a grid search approach to empirically determine the optimal $\tau$ for aligning these curves. By validating that \(\frac{\Delta \text{ICP}}{\Delta \text{Na}}\) contains relevant and essential information for predicting outcomes, we emphasize its potential value for informing ICU treatment decisions.
