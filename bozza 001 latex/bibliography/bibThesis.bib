  abstract = {Introduction: Hypernatremia is a common problem in hospitalized patients and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. This study was designed to evaluate whether physicians follow the recommended guidelines for the rate of correction of hypernatremia of Յ0.5 mEq/L/hr and to evaluate the effect of the rate of correction of severe hypernatremia on the mortality of hospitalized patients. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 131 consecutively hospitalized patients with severe hypernatremia (serum sodium Ն155 mEq/L) was performed. Primary outcomes were 30-day patient mortality and 72hour hypernatremia correction. The first 24-hour serum sodium (Naϩ) correction rate was tested as a categorical variable; slow rate (Ͻ0.25 mEq/L/hr) and fast rate (Ն0.25 mEq/L/hr). Results: The mean admission serum Naϩ level was 159 Ϯ 3 mEq/L. Ninety percent of patients received the recommended Ͻ0.5 mEq/L/hr serum Naϩ correction rate; however, hypernatremia was corrected only in 27\% of patients after 72 hours of treatment. Thirty-day patient mortality rate was 37\%. In multivariable analysis, do not resuscitate status [hazards ratio (HR), 3.85; P Ͻ 0.0001], slower correction rate of hypernatremia (HR, 2.63; P ϭ 0.02) and high heart rate (Ͼ100 beats/min; HR, 1.99; P ϭ 0.03) were the independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Conclusion: In patients with severe hypernatremia, the rate of correction of hypernatremia was slow and resulted in inadequate correction in majority of the patients. Both slow rate of hypernatremia correction during the first 24 hours and do not resuscitate status were found to be significant predictors of 30-day patient mortality.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Organ congestion is a mediator of adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. Point-Of-Care ultrasound (POCUS) is widely available and could enable clinicians to detect signs of venous congestion at the bedside. The aim of this study was to develop several grading system prototypes using POCUS and to determine their respective ability to predict acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery. This is a post-hoc analysis of a single-center prospective study in 145 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for which repeated daily measurements of hepatic, portal, intra-renal vein Doppler and inferior vena cava (IVC) ultrasound were performed during the first 72 h after surgery. Five prototypes of venous excess ultrasound (VExUS) grading system combining multiple ultrasound markers were developed. Results:{\enspace} The association between each score and AKI was assessed using time-dependant Cox models as well as conventional performance measures of diagnostic testing. A total of 706 ultrasound assessments were analyzed. We found that defining severe venous congestion as the presence of severe flow abnormalities in multiple Dop-pler patterns with a dilated IVC ({$\geq$}\,2 cm) showed the strongest association with the development of subsequent AKI compared with other combinations (HR: 3.69 CI 1.65--8.24 p\,=\,0.001). The association remained significant after adjust-ment for baseline risk of AKI and vasopressor/inotropic support (HR: 2.82 CI 1.21--6.55 p\,=\,0.02). Furthermore, this severe VExUS grade offered a useful positive likelihood ratio (+LR: 6.37 CI 2.19--18.50) when detected at ICU admis-sion, which outperformed central venous pressure measurements. Conclusions:{\enspace} The combination of multiple POCUS markers may identify clinically significant venous congestion.},

  abstract = {Background. Suppression ratio (SR) derived from bispectral index (BIS) monitoring is correlated to EEG burst suppression. It may occur during deep anaesthesia, but also in the case of metabolic or haemodynamic brain injury. The goal of the study was to describe the occurrence of SR and to determine factors associated with SR during propofol --remifentanil general anaesthesia maintenance. Methods. We conducted a post hoc analysis of BIS recordings in consecutive patients included in two multi-centre trials, undergoing non-cardiac surgery using a dual closedloop BIS controller allowing automated propofol--remifentanil administration. The percentage of time spent with a BIS value between 40 and 60 (TBIS 40 -- 60) was measured. Two groups of patients were defined: the SR group, including patients with at least one episode of SR value .10\% lasting more than 1 min, and the control group. Factors associated with SR were analysed using a stepwise multivariate analysis. Results. A total of 1494 patients [age{$\frac{1}{4}$}57 (17) yr; TBIS 40 -- 60{$\frac{1}{4}$}76 (17\%)] were analysed and 131 (8.7\%) patients constituted the SR group. The main independent factors associated with SR were advanced age [odds ratio (95\% confidence interval){$\frac{1}{4}$}4.80 (1.85 --12.43) (P{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.027), 10.59 (3.76 --29.81) (P,0.0001), for categories of age 60 --80 and .80 yr, respectively], history of coronary artery disease (CAD) [2.53 (1.47 --4.37) (P{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.001)] and male gender [1.57 (1.03 --2.40) (P{$\frac{1}{4}$}0.03)]. Conclusions. The occurrence of SR during BIS-controlled propofol and remifentanil anaesthesia is mainly observed in elderly male patients or in patients with a history of CAD. The mechanisms underlying SR and the potential consequences for the patient's postoperative outcome remain unsolved.},

  abstract = {Background: Fluid overload is deleterious in critically ill patients. It can lead to venous congestion, thereby increasing venous pressure, theoretically increasing the backpressure, and thereby reducing renal blood flow. Venous congestion thus can be an important contributor to acute kidney injury (AKI), with no validated tools to objectively identify venous congestion bedside. Materials and methods: Patients above 18 years admitted in ICU with a provisional diagnosis of cardiorenal syndrome were included in the study. Those with inadequate window, inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus, and known case of cirrhosis with portal hypertension were excluded from the study. Patients underwent ultrasound examination with serial determination till AKI resolved or patient is initiated on dialysis. Venous excess ultrasound score (VEXUS) comprising inferior vena cava, hepatic vein waveform, and portal vein pulsatility was assessed. Results: Thirty patients were enrolled for the study. The mean age was 59.53 {\textpm} 16.47 with 21 (70\%) males. Mean sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score was 5.03 {\textpm} 1.97. Fourteen patients (46.7\%) were in AKI stage 1, while eight patients (26.7\%) were in AKI stage 2 and stage 3 each. Twenty patients (66.7\%) had VEXUS grade III. Resolution of AKI injury showed significant correlation with improvement in VEXUS grade (p value 0.003). Similarly, there was significant association between changes in VEXUS grade and fluid balance (p value 0.006). There was no correlation between central venous pressure (CVP), left ventricular function, and right ventricular function with change in VEXUS grade. Conclusion: The study shows that a combined grading of IVC, hepatic vein, and portal vein might reliably demonstrate venous congestion and aid in the clinical decision to perform fluid removal.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly being used in healthcare, thanks to the high level of performance that these systems have proven to deliver. So far, clinical applications have focused on diagnosis and on prediction of outcomes. It is less clear in what way AI can or should support complex clinical decisions that crucially depend on patient preferences. In this paper, we focus on the ethical questions arising from the design, development and deployment of AI systems to support decision-making around cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the determination of a patient's Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate status (also known as code status). The COVID-19 pandemic has made us keenly aware of the difficulties physicians encounter when they have to act quickly in stressful situations without knowing what their patient would have wanted. We discuss the results of an interview study conducted with healthcare professionals in a university hospital aimed at understanding the status quo of resuscitation decision processes while exploring a potential role for AI systems in decision-making around code status. Our data suggest that (1) current practices are fraught with challenges such as insufficient knowledge regarding patient preferences, time pressure and personal bias guiding care considerations and (2) there is considerable openness among clinicians to consider the use of AI-based decision support. We suggest a model for how AI can contribute to improve decision-making around resuscitation and propose a set of ethically relevant preconditions---conceptual, methodological and procedural---that need to be considered in further development and implementation efforts.},

In patients from the Saline vs. Albumin Fluid Evaluation (SAFE) study with TBI who underwent intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, interventional data were collected from randomization to day 14 to determine changes in ICP (primary outcome) and in therapies used to treat increased ICP. Pattern mixture modelling, designed to address informative dropouts, was used to compare temporal changes between the albumin and saline groups, and 321 patients were identified, of whom 164 (51.1\%) received albumin and 157 (48.9\%) received saline. There was a significant linear increase in mean ICP and significantly more deaths in the albumin group compared with saline when ICP monitoring was discontinued during the first week (1.30 -- 0.33 vs. - 0.37 -- 0.36, p = 0.0006; and 34.4\% vs. 17.4\%; p = 0.006 respectively), but not when monitoring ceased during the second week (- 0.08 -- 0.44 vs. - 0.23 -- 0.38, p = 0.79; and 18.6\% vs. 12.1\%; p = 0.36 respectively). There were statistically significant differences in the mean total daily doses of morphine (- 0.42 -- 0.07 vs. - 0.66 -- 0.0, p = 0.0009), propofol (- 0.45 -- 0.11 vs. - 0.76 -- 0.11; p = 0.034) and norepinephrine (- 0.50 -- 0.07 vs. - 0.74 -- 0.07) and in temperature (0.03 -- 0.03 vs. 0.16 -- 0.03; p = 0.0014) between the albumin and saline groups when ICP monitoring ceased during the first week. The use of albumin for resuscitation in patients with severe TBI is associated with increased ICP during the first week. This is the most likely mechanism of increased mortality in these patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the development of significant interhemispheric intracranial pressure (ICP) gradients in the setting of unilateral stroke remains controversial, no study to date has investigated the existence of these gradients in a controlled, reproducible, clinically relevant model. Therefore, we used a primate model of reperfused hemispheric stroke to better characterize the development of these gradients. METHODS: Bilateral intraparenchymal ICP was continuously monitored in 7 adult male baboons subjected to left hemisphere reperfused stroke. Interhemispheric ICP gradients were calculated for each baboon and plotted over time. Infarct volume was determined using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at sacrifice. RESULTS: A bimodal distribution of interhemispheric ICP gradients was observed in animals with {$>$}20\% infarct volume (22.1\% +/- 0.9; range 21-23\%) versus {$<$} or = 15\% infarct volume (6.6\% +/- 2.7; range 1-15\%). In animals with {$>$}20\% infarct volume, interhemispheric gradients developed early and persisted throughout the monitoring period. At 12 hours postreperfusion, animals with large infarcts demonstrated a mean pressure gradient of 13.8 +/- 4.3 mm Hg, compared to a mean gradient of -2.6 +/- 1.1 mm Hg for animals with {$<$} or =15\% infarct volume. The difference in pressure gradients was statistically significant at all time points from 4 to 12 hours postreperfusion (p {$<$} 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that, in nonhuman primates, infarcts of a size approaching 20\% of the hemisphere may be associated with significant ICP gradients. With these larger infarcts, ipsilateral monitoring is required if regional cerebral perfusion pressure is to be accurately assessed.},

We performed a comprehensive literature review to determine grades of recommendation for commonly used agents in multimodal pain management and provide a best practice guideline. To evaluate common drugs used in multimodal treatment of pain, a search was performed on English language publications on Medline (PubMed; National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD, USA). Manuscripts were rated as Level I-V according to the North American Spine Society's (NASS) standardized levels of evidence tables. Grades of recommendation were assigned for each drug based on the NASS Clinical Guidelines for Multidisciplinary Spine Care. There is good (Grade A) evidence gabapentinoids, acetaminophen, neuraxial blockade and extended-release local anesthetics reduce postoperative pain and narcotic requirements. There is fair (Grade B) evidence that preemptive analgesia and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) result in reduced postoperative pain. There is insufficient and/or conflicting (Grade I) evidence that muscle relaxants and ketamine provide a significant reduction in postoperative pain or narcotic usage. There is fair (Grade B) evidence that short-term use of NSAID result in no long-term reduction in bone healing or fusion rates. Comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of perioperative pain control can be accomplished through the use of validated measures. Multimodal pain management protocols have consistently been demonstrated to allow for improved pain control with less reliance on opioids. There is good quality evidence that supports many of the common agents utilized in multimodal therapy, however, there is a lack of evidence regarding optimal postoperative protocols or pathways.},

Touch screen apps may enable patients to initiate communication and improve their interactions. Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the pertinent features of iPad-based apps designed for communication in ICU. Methods Apple ``App Store'' and Google ``Play Store'' were searched for keywords ``communication'' and ``intensive care.'' Related app suggestions were screened. Two independent assessors evaluated iPad-based apps that were deemed useful. The assessors resolved the discrepancies by re-evaluating the apps and reaching a consensus. Results Nine apps met the inclusion criteria. Of these six apps were free. There were seven apps specific to intensive care. Most apps had preloaded phrases for the patient to request to see someone (e.g., family), personal hygiene (e.g., bowel care), seek help with symptoms (e.g., pain), or a comfort item (e.g., blanket). CALD Assist, Patient Communicator, VidaTalk, and YoDoc were available in more than eight languages. VidaTalk and YoDoc allowed the user to write. Four apps were deemed not suitable for routine ICU use, while the remaining five had several attractive features. Conclusion Several high-quality apps are available to assist with patient-initiated communication exchange in ICU. This study provides a guide for readers to choose the app most suited to their needs. In the opinion of the authors, YoDoc is the most suitable app for routine use in ICU. Among free apps, CommuniCare appears to be the most user-friendly.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE{\enspace} Fluctuations in patient serum sodium levels are common after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), but their effect on patient outcome is not well described in the literature. The goal of this work was to better characterize the relationship between fluctuations in serum sodium levels, outcome, and the development of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aSAH. METHODS{\enspace} The authors performed a post hoc analysis of data from the Clazosentan to Overcome Neurological Ischemia and Infarction Occurring After Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (CONSCIOUS-1) trial. Patients had their serum sodium values recorded daily for 14 days post-aSAH. Average and average absolute daily differences in sodium levels were calculated for each patient based on 3 reference points: admission sodium levels, a normal sodium level (defined as 140 mmol/L), and the previous day's sodium level. These variables were also calculated for the classic ``vasospasm window'' (days 3--12) post-aSAH. A stepwise logistic regression model, locally weighted scatterplot smoothing curves, and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis were used to evaluate the relationship between alterations in serum sodium levels and clinical outcome or the development of DCI after aSAH. Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of {$>$} 2 at 3 months. RESULTS{\enspace} The average daily difference in sodium values from baseline (p {$<$} 0.001), average daily difference from a normal sodium level (p {$<$} 0.001), average absolute daily difference from a normal sodium level (p = 0.015), and average absolute daily difference from the previous day's sodium level (p = 0.017) were significant predictors of poor outcome in a stepwise multivariate regression model. There was a trend toward significance for average absolute daily difference from admission sodium levels during the vasospasm window as an independent predictor of DCI (p = 0.052). There was no difference in the predictive capacity for DCI when sodium fluctuations from post-aSAH days 1--14 were compared with those from the classic vasospasm window (days 3--12). CONCLUSIONS{\enspace} Fluctuations in serum sodium levels may play a role in clinical outcome and the development of DCI after aSAH. The timing of these fluctuations appears to have no significant effect on the development of DCI. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2018.3.JNS173068},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: MargheritaTre is an electronic health record developed by the Italian Group for the Evaluation of Interventions in Intensive Care Medicine designed to support clinical practice in intensive care units (ICUs) and ensure high-quality data for research purposes. APPROACH: MargheritaTre was developed in collaboration with clinical experts, researchers, and IT specialists. It is currently installed in 40 ICUs and its database contains complete records of more than 65,000 patients. To facilitate data analysis, information is mostly stored in structured or partially structured form. MAIN RESULTS: Data collected with MargheritaTre allow one to conduct research studies on complex clinical problems from manifold perspectives and with different levels of detail, such as epidemiological studies, analyses of the process of care and physiopathological investigations, at both single-organ and organism level. In this paper we describe some of the first projects based on this electronic health record to illustrate its potential for research. SIGNIFICANCE: The MargheritaTre database is a huge and rapidly growing mine of data that will be exploited by our laboratory and shared with other groups to address complex and innovative research and clinical questions. The ultimate aim of these projects is the improvement of the quality of care and patient outcomes, through the development of expert systems integrated in the electronic health record to support clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives Although not well known, post-laminectomy syndrome (PLS) is an important cause of chronic back pain, which may lead to decreased quality of life, disability and psychological disorders. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and prevalence of PLS, to estimate its impact on the quality of life and to determine its association with anxiety, depression and disability in patients at public hospitals in S{\~a}o Lu{\'i}s, MA. Methods Cross-sectional, descriptive and analytical study. Eighteen patients characterized as having PLS were selected, and their clinical, epidemiological and psychological characteristics, their quality of life and their levels of physical fitness were evaluated through clinical evaluations, Beck questionnaires, the Short Form-36 (SF-36), the Rolland-Morris questionnaire and the Douleur Neurophatique 4 questions. The multidimensional pain evaluation was performed using the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Results The prevalence of post-laminectomy pain was 60~\%. Most of the patients assessed in this study were male and received a family income of up to minimum wage; their mean age was 45~years. All of the patients presented with chronic, intense pain that had lasted an average of 7.22~years. The prevalence of neuropathic pain was 89.9~\%. The physical appearance and functional capacity domains of the SF-36 were classified as unsatisfactory in 94.4 and 83.3~\% of the patients, respectively. None of the patients exhibited high levels of physical fitness. The average score was 21.33 for anxiety and 18.88 for depression. There was a strongly positive and significant relationship between the anxiety and depression scores. Additionally, there was a moderately positive and significant relationship between the disability and anxiety scores. Regarding the correlation between the pain intensity and the quality of life, there was a moderately significant relationship between the patients' mental health and their vitality. Conclusion PLS exhibits a high prevalence and significance, and it causes high levels of morbidity in patients. Furthermore, PLS features intense levels of pain, reduced quality of life and greater physical and occupational disability.

  abstract = {The definition of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) secondary insults in severe traumatic brain injury remains unclear. The purpose of the present study is to visualize the association of intensity and duration of episodes below or above CPP thresholds and outcome. The analysis was based on prospectively collected minute-by-minute intracranial pressure (ICP) and blood pressure data and outcome from 259 adult patients. The relationship of episodes of CPP below or above a certain threshold for certain duration with the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Score was visualized separately for episodes of active or deficient autoregulation (AR). In adults {$\leq$}65 years, an almost exponential transition curve separates the episodes of CPP associated with better outcomes from the episodes of low CPP associated with worse outcomes, indicating that lower CPP could only be tolerated for a brief time. Analysis of episodes of high CPP again showed a time-intensity dependent association with outcome. When combining the two plots, a safe CPP zone between 60 and 70\,mm Hg could be delineated---however, only for AR active insults. The AR status predominantly affected the transition curve for insults of low CPP. Episodes with ICP {$>$}25\,mm Hg were associated with poor outcome regardless of CPP. In the present study, the CPP pressure-time burden associated with poor outcome was visualized. A safe zone between 60 and 70\,mm Hg could be identified for adults {$\leq$}65 years, provided AR was active and ICP was {$\leq$}25\,mm Hg. Deficient AR reduces the tolerability for low CPP.},

Design: Each TBI patient underwent sequential measurement of PC, plasma sodium, urine osmolality, and fluid balance after TBI. All other anterior pituitary hormones were measured on day 10 after TBI. The results from 15 surgical comparisons defined a PC less than 300 nmol/L as inappropriately low for an acutely ill patient. CDI was diagnosed according to standard criteria. Surviving TBI patients underwent dynamic anterior pituitary testing at least 6 months after TBI. Setting: The patients were recruited from the Irish National Neurosurgery Centre. Patients: One hundred sequential TBI patients were recruited. Fifteen patients admitted to Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) after major surgery were recruited as comparison patients. Main Outcome Measures: PC in TBI patients was compared with that of comparison patients. The mortality rate was compared between TBI patients with and without acute hypocortisolemia. Results of follow-up dynamic pituitary testing were compared between those with and without acute hypocortisolemia.

Methods: SAH patients were treated with clipping or coiling from September 2017 to August 2020 at five hos\- pitals. The laboratory data of 133 SAH patients were collected over 14 days and correlations between changes in serum sodium, sodium metabolism-related hormones (plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), serum cortisol, plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP)), and SVS were determined. Serum sodium concentrations were measured every day and serum sodium levels {$>$}135 mEq/L were maintained until day 14. Results: Of the 133 patients, 18 developed SVS within 14 days of subarachnoid hemorrhage onset (SVS group) and 115 did not suffer from SVS (non-SVS group). Circulating AVP, ACTH, and cortisol concentrations were significantly higher on day 1 in the SVS group compared with the non-SVS group. Fluctuations in serum sodium in the SVS group were significantly higher than those in the non-SVS group. There were antiparallel fluctuations in serum sodium and potassium from days 2 to 14. Conclusions: Elevated levels of ACTH/cortisol and AVP on day 1 may be predictive markers for the occurrence of SVS. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that serum sodium fluctuations were associated with SVS occurrence. Serum sodium fluctuations were associated with stress-related hormonal dynamics.

We provide a three-tier algorithm for treating elevated ICP. Treatments within a tier are considered empirically equivalent. Higher tiers involve higher risk therapies. Tiers 1, 2, and 3 include 10, 4, and 3 interventions, respectively. We include inter-tier considerations, and recommendations for critical neuroworsening to assist the recognition and treatment of declining patients. Novel elements include guidance for autoregulation-based ICP treatment based on MAP Challenge results, and two heatmaps to guide (1) ICP-monitor removal and (2) consideration of sedation holidays for neurological examination.

Methods: Data were collected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Restricted cubic splines were used to explore the relationship between serum sodium and in-hospital mortality. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to calculate the optimal cuto value of sodium fluctuation, and decision curve analysis was plotted to show the net benefit of di erent models containing serum sodium. Results: A total of patients with spontaneous SAH were included in the retrospective analysis. The level of sodium on ICU admission and minimum sodium in the ICU had a statistically significant non-linear relationship with inhospital mortality (non-linear P-value {$<$} . , total P-value {$<$} . ). Serum sodium on ICU admission, minimum serum sodium during ICU, and sodium fluctuation were independently associated with in-hospital mortality with odds ratios being . ( \% confidence interval (CI): . -- . , P = . ), . ( \% CI: . - . , P {$<$} . ), and . ( \% CI: . -- . , P = . ), respectively. The optimal cuto point was . mmol/L to identify in-hospital death of patients with spontaneous SAH with sodium fluctuation, with an AUC of . ( \% CI . - . ). Conclusion: Among patients with spontaneous SAH, we found a J-shaped association between serum sodium on ICU admission and minimum sodium values during ICU with in-hospital mortality.

  abstract = {Background Cerebrovascular autoregulation (CA) regulates cerebral vascular tone to maintain near-constant cerebral blood flow during fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Preclinical and clinical research has challenged the classic triphasic pressure-flow relationship, leaving the normal pressure-flow relationship unclear. Methods and Results We used in vivo imaging of the hemodynamic response in pial arterioles to study CA in a porcine closed cranial window model during nonpharmacological blood pressure manipulation. Red blood cell flux was determined in 52 pial arterioles during 10 hypotension and 10 hypertension experiments to describe the pressure-flow relationship. We found a quadriphasic pressure-flow relationship with 4 distinct physiological phases. Smaller arterioles demonstrated greater vasodilation during low CPP when compared with large arterioles (P{$<$}0.01), whereas vasoconstrictive capacity during high CPP was not significantly different between arterioles (P{$>$}0.9). The upper limit of CA was defined by 2 breakpoints. Increases in CPP lead to a point of maximal vasoconstriction of the smallest pial arterioles (upper limit of autoregulation [ULA] 1). Beyond ULA1, only larger arterioles maintain a limited additional vasoconstrictive capacity, extending the buffer for high CPP. Beyond ULA2, vasoconstrictive capacity is exhausted, and all pial arterioles passively dilate. There was substantial intersubject variability, with ranges of 29.2, 47.3, and 50.9~mm~Hg for the lower limit, ULA1, and ULA2, respectively. Conclusions We provide new insights into the quadriphasic physiology of CA, differentiating between truly active CA and an extended capacity to buffer increased CPP with progressive failure of CA. In this experimental model, the limits of CA widely varied between subjects.},

  abstract = {Marked dysnatraemia is associated with increased mortality in patients admitted to intensive care. However, new evidence suggests that even mild deviations from normal and simple variability of sodium values may also be signi cant. Should these ndings prompt clinicians to re-evaluate the approach to uid management in this setting? Sodium disorders, on one hand, are known to result from overzealous administration or restriction of free water or sodium ions. However, they are also associated with a range of co-morbidities and drug treatments that alter water loss and sodium handling in the nephron independently of prescribed uid regimens. Moreover, powerful neuroendocrine and in ammatory responses to surgery, trauma and other acute illness may induce or intensify such changes, altering the response to administered uids. These observations suggest that both patient and treatment variables contribute, but the extent to which sodium disturbances are preventable and whether prevention improves outcome are unknown. Dysnatraemia certainly re ects underlying systemic disorders, but how important is uid management as a cause, and does it contribute independently to poorer outcomes through osmotic or other mechanisms? Although total uid volume and doses of potassium and glucose are regularly adjusted in critically ill patients, sodium is usually delivered at standard concentrations as long as serum values lie within an acceptable range. It may be prudent to pay closer attention to these values, especially when abnormal, when uctuating or when an adverse trend is present. More frequent measurements of sodium in blood, urine and drainage uids, and appropriate adjustment of the sodium content of prescribed uids, may be indicated. Until more light can be shed on the pathophysiology of dysnatraemia in the critically ill, we should assume that better control of plasma sodium levels may yield better outcomes.},

  abstract = {The severity of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is determined by many variables, the complexity of which has made prediction of functional outcome an elusive target. To evaluate whether the three components of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and their alterations over time can serve as predictors of functional outcome after a severe TBI at 12 months after the TBI insult, we carried out a prospective study of patients with severe TBI. Seventy patients were initially enrolled. Data were retrieved from the emergency department records and the patients' intensive care unit, neurosurgical, and rehabilitation unit records. All patients underwent follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months after injury. GCS components were evaluated on the day of injury and 2 weeks after injury. Functional outcome was estimated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale and the Functional Independence Measure motor scale. It was evaluated during rehabilitation and at 12 months after injury. Fifty-one patients were alive and followed up until 12 months. Logistic regression and receiver-operator characteristic curve analyses were carried out. In terms of functional outcome at 12 months, only GCS on day 15 was found to be a prognostic factor, with all its subscales being related to outcome 12 months later, whereas a higher GCS score on day 15 was also related to survival. A higher motor and verbal response on day 15 was strongly associated with a patient's functional independence, whereby the motor response was a better predictor. The GCS motor score 2 weeks after injury was statistically significantly associated with the 12-month functional outcome in TBI survivors. Motor response was the most useful predictor among the GCS components with respect to the long-term functional outcome in patients with severe TBI.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To perform a detailed examination of sodium levels, hyponatremia and sodium fluctuations, and their association with delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). DESIGN: An observational cohort study from a prospective SAH Registry. SETTING: Tertiary referral center focused on SAH treatment in the Amsterdam metropolitan area. PATIENTS: A total of 964 adult patients with confirmed aSAH were included between 2011 and 2021. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 277 (29\%) developed DCI. Hyponatremia occurred significantly more often in DCI patients compared with no-DCI patients (77\% vs. 48\%). Sodium levels, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, and sodium fluctuations did not predict DCI. However, higher sodium levels were significantly associated with poor outcome in DCI patients (DCI onset --7, DCI +0, +1, +2, +4, +5, +8, +9 d), and in no-DCI patients (postbleed day 6--10 and 12--14). Also, hypernatremia and greater sodium fluctuations were significantly associated with poor outcome in both DCI and no-DCI patients. CONCLUSIONS: Sodium levels, hyponatremia, and sodium fluctuations were not associated with the occurrence of DCI. However, higher sodium levels, hypernatremia, and greater sodium fluctuations were associated with poor outcome after aSAH irrespective of the presence of DCI. Therefore, sodium levels, even with mild changes in levels, warrant close attention.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews the pathophysiology and management of cerebral edema, brain compression, and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). It also provides a brief introduction to the concept of the glymphatic system and select cellular contributors to cerebral edema. RECENT FINDINGS: Cerebral edema and brain compression should be treated in a tiered approach after the patient demonstrates a symptomatic indication to start treatment. All patients with acute brain injury should be treated with standard measures to optimize intracranial compliance and minimize risk of ICP elevation. When ICP monitors are used, therapies should target maintaining ICP at 22 mm Hg or less. Evidence exists that serial clinical examination and neuroimaging may be a reasonable alternative to ICP monitoring; however, clinical trials in progress may demonstrate advantages to advanced monitoring techniques. Early decompressive craniectomy and hypothermia are not neuroprotective in traumatic brain injury and should be reserved for situations refractory to initial medical interventions. Medical therapies that acutely lower plasma osmolality may lead to neurologic deterioration from osmotic cerebral edema, and patients with acute brain injury and renal or liver failure are at elevated risk. SUMMARY: A tiered approach to the management of cerebral edema and brain compression can reduce secondary brain injury when implemented according to core physiologic principles. However, our knowledge of the pathophysiology of acute brain injury is incomplete, and the conceptual framework underlying decades of clinical management may need to be revised in response to currently evolving discoveries regarding the pathophysiology of acute brain injury.},

  abstract = {ObjectiveTo assess zero drift of intraventricular and subdural intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring systems. MethodsA prospective study was conducted in patients who received Codman ICP monitoring in the neurosurgical department from January 2010 to December 2011. According to the location of sensors, the patients were categorized into two groups: intraventricular group and subdural group. Zero drift between the two groups and its association with the duration of ICP monitor were analyzed. ResultsTotally, 22 patients undergoing intraventricular ICP monitoring and 27 receiving subdural ICP monitoring were enrolled. There was no significant difference in duration of ICP monitoring, zero drift value and its absolute value between intraventricular and subdural groups (5.38 d{\textpm}2.58 d vs 4.58 d{\textpm}2.24 d, 0.77mm Hg{\textpm}2.18mm Hg vs 1.03mm Hg{\textpm}2.06mm Hg, 1.68mm Hg{\textpm}1.55mm Hg vs 1.70mm Hg{\textpm}1.53mm Hg, respectively; all P{$>$}0.05). Absolute value of zero drift in both groups significantly rose with the increased duration of ICP monitoring (P{$<$}0.05) while zero drift value did not. Moreover, daily absolute value in the intraventricular group was significantly smaller than that in the subdural group (0.27mm Hg{\textpm}0.32mm Hg vs 0.29mm Hg{\textpm}0.18mm Hg, P{$<$}0.05). ConclusionThis study demonstrates that absolute value of zero drift significantly correlates with duration of both intraventricular and subdural ICP monitoring. Due to the smaller daily absolute value, ICP values recorded from intraventricular system may be more reliable than those from subdural system.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia is common among inpatients and is associated with severe adverse outcomes such as osmotic demyelination syndrome. Current guidelines recommend serum sodium concentration correction targets of no more than 8 mEq/L per day in patients at high risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome. Desmopressin is recommended to control high rates of serum sodium concentration correction in severe hyponatremia. However, recommendations are based on limited data. The objective of this study is to review current strategies for DDAVP use in severe hyponatremia. METHODS: Systematic literature search of 4 databases of peer-reviewed studies was performed and study quality was appraised. RESULTS: The literature search identified 17 observational studies with 80 patients. We found 3 strategies for desmopressin administration in hyponatremia: 1) proactive, where desmopressin is administered early based on initial serum sodium concentration; 2) reactive, where desmopressin is administered based on changes in serum sodium concentration or urine output; 3) rescue, where desmopressin is administered after serum sodium correction targets are exceeded or when osmotic demyelination appears imminent. A proactive strategy of desmopressin administration with hypertonic saline was associated with lower incidence of exceeding serum sodium concentration correction targets, although this evidence is derived from a small case series. CONCLUSIONS: Three distinct strategies for desmopressin administration are described in the literature. Limitations in study design and sample size prevent definitive conclusions about the optimal strategy for desmopressin administration to correct hyponatremia. There is a pressing need for better quality research to guide clinicians in managing severe hyponatremia.},

Promptly diagnosing conditions in which sodium levels rapidly change are especially important in this patient population because of the effect on cerebral volume. When sodium levels change quickly, large shifts in water occur over the cellular membrane, which can lead to neuronal and cell swelling or shrinkage. Inappropriate or delayed diagnosis and treatment may lead to severe morbidity or even death. The rate of correction of these derangements depends on how rapidly the onset occurred. In this review, we will discuss hypernatremia and hyponatremia and their retrospective etiologies, diagnoses, treatments, and complications.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Serum sodium derangement is the most common electrolyte disturbance among patients admitted to intensive care. This study aims to validate the association between dysnatremia and serum sodium fluctuation with mortality in surgical intensive care patients. Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care II database. Dysnatremia was defined as a sodium concentration outside physiologic range (135-145 mmol/L) and subjects were categorized by severity of dysnatremia and sodium fluctuation. Univariate and multivariable logistic regressions were used to test for associations between sodium fluctuations and mortality. Results: We identified 8600 subjects, 39\% of whom were female, with a median age of 66 years for analysis. Subjects with dysnatremia were more likely to be dead at 28 days (17\% vs 7\%; P b .001). There was a significant association between sodium fluctuation and mortality at 28 days (adjusted odds ratio per 1 mmol/L change, 1.10 [95\% confidence interval, 1.08-1.12; P b .001]), even in patients who remained normotremic during their intensive care unit stay (1.12 [95\% confidence interval, 1.09-1.16; P b .001]) Conclusions: This observational study validates previous findings of an association between serum sodium fluctuations and mortality in surgical intensive care patients. This association was also present in subjects who remained normonatremic throughout their intensive care unit admission.},

  abstract = {Delirium is a debilitating form of brain dysfunction frequently encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, longer lengths of stay, higher hospital costs, and cognitive impairment that persists long after hospital discharge. Predisposing factors include smoking, hypertension, cardiac disease, sepsis, and premorbid dementia. Precipitating factors include respiratory failure and shock, metabolic disturbances, prolonged mechanical ventilation, pain, immobility, and sedatives and adverse environmental conditions impairing vision, hearing, and sleep. Historically, antipsychotic medications were the mainstay of delirium treatment in the critically ill. Based on more recent literature, the current Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines suggest against routine use of antipsychotics for delirium in critically ill adults. Other pharmacologic interventions (e.g., dexmedetomidine) are under investigation and their impact is not yet clear. Nonpharmacologic interventions thus remain the cornerstone of delirium management. This approach is summarized in the ABCDEF bundle (Assess, prevent, and manage pain; Both SAT and SBT; Choice of analgesia and sedation; Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage; Early mobility and exercise; Family engagement and empowerment). The implementation of this bundle reduces the odds of developing delirium and the chances of needing mechanical ventilation, yet there are challenges to its implementation. There is an urgent need for ongoing studies to more effectively mitigate risk factors and to better understand the pathobiology underlying ICU delirium so as to identify additional potential treatments. Further refinements of therapeutic options, from drugs to rehabilitation, are current areas ripe for study to improve the short- and long-term outcomes of critically ill patients with delirium.},

Each response has something to say regarding the scope of healthcare's responsibility to mitigate climate change. This can be explored at the intuitional or structural level, or at the individual patient and practitioner level leading to a further issue of the relationship between these perspectives. Coverdale argues for broadening the scope of individual responsibilities regarding the climate.2 Discussing inhalers does not go far enough and doctors, argues Coverdale, are well placed to draw attention to the various behaviour changes patients can undertake both through role modelling and in the clinic. While Coverdale makes some excellent points, I have three worries about his proposal. One is relevance. Climate concerns may not always be pertinent in the clinical encounter; think of counselling a bereaved patient or somebody needing a fit note. Related to this is opportunity.

Methods:{\enspace} A preplanned subanalysis of the SYNAPSE-ICU study, a multicentre, prospective, international, observational cohort study, describing the ICP treatment, graded according to Therapy Intensity Level (TIL) scale, in patients with ABI during the first week of intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

During the first week from ICU admission, no-basic TIL was used in 382 (16.5\%) patients, mild-moderate in 1643 (70.8\%), and extreme in 295 cases (eTIL, 12.7\%). Patients who received eTIL were younger (median age 49 (I--III quartiles\,=\,35--62) vs 56 (40--69) years, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), with less cardiovascular pre-injury comorbidities (859 (44\%) vs 90 (31.4\%), p\,{$<$}\,0.001), with more episodes of neuroworsening (160 (56.1\%) vs 653 (33.3\%), p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and were more frequently monitored with an ICP device (221 (74.9\%) vs 1037 (51.2\%), p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Considerable variability in the frequency of use and type of eTIL adopted was observed between centres and countries. At six months, patients who received no-basic TIL had an increased risk of mortality (Hazard ratio, HR\,=\,1.612, 95\% Confidence Interval, CI\,=\,1.243--2.091, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) compared to patients who received eTIL. No difference was observed when comparing mild-moderate TIL with eTIL (HR\,=\,1.017, 95\% CI\,=\,0.823--1.257, p\,=\,0.873). No significant association between the use of TIL and neurological outcome was observed.

  abstract = {Background: Critically ill patients commonly require endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes and mechanical ventilation for respiratory airway compromise. The use of artificial airways and mechanical ventilation prohibits traditional verbal communication. Although some mechanically ventilated patients are able to communicate through mouthing words, gesturing, or writing, many are unable to do so effectively as a result of weakness, fatigue, or attachment to devices that restrict movement. Difficulties in communication can result in unmet needs (i.e., difficulty communicating a symptom) and communication breakdowns, which are frustrating for patients, families, and clinicians. Purpose: To explore the feasibility and usefulness of using a tablet equipped with communication app in the intensive care unit (ICU) with patients who are unable to communicate using verbal speech. Method: We conducted a pilot, observational study, approved by the local Research Ethics Board. Twenty patients with endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes were deemed eligible for the study and used the tablet equipped with an app to communicate with their bedside clinicians. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by point of care clinicians to determine their perspectives on the feasibility and usefulness of the tablet and communication app. Results: All patients who met eligibility criteria and consented to the study used the communication device at least once during the trial period, demonstrating its feasibility. On a scale of 0 (not at all useful) to 10 (incredibly useful), 75\% rated its usefulness seven or greater, mean rating of 7 (range 3-10). Conclusion: The tablet equipped with communication app is a feasible and useful device for patients and clinicians. Further exploration is needed to understand the contribution of this communication system for patients and health care professionals.},

  abstract = {Intracranial pressure (ICP) burden or pressure time dose (PTD) is a valuable clinical indicator for pending intracranial hypertension, mostly based on threshold exceedance. Pulse frequency and waveform morphology (WFM) of the ICP signal contribute to PTD. The temporal resolution of the ICP signal has a great influence on PTD calculation but has not been systematically studied yet. Hence, the temporal resolution of the ICP signal on PTD calculation is investigated. We retrospectively analysed continuous 48 h ICP recordings with high temporal resolution obtained from 94 patients at the intensive care unit who underwent neurosurgery due to an intracranial haemorrhage and received an intracranial pressure probe (43 females, median age: 72 years, range: 23 to 88 years). The cumulative area under the curve above the threshold of 20 mmHg was compared for different temporal resolutions of the ICP signal (beat-to-beat, 1 s, 300 s, 1800 s, 3600 s). Events with prolonged ICP elevation were compared to those with few isolated threshold exceedances. PTD increased for lower temporal resolutions independent of WFM and frequency of threshold exceedance. PTDbeat-to-beat best reflected the impact of frequency of threshold exceedance and WFM. Events that could be distinguished in PTDbeat-to-beat became magnified more than 7-fold in PTD1s and more than 104 times in PTD1h, indicating an overestimation of PTD. PTD calculation should be standardised, and beat-by-beat PTD could serve as an easy-to-grasp indicator for the impact of frequency and WFM of ICP elevations on ICP burden.},

  abstract = {Background: Dysnatremias are associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. Hypernatremia in burn patients is also associated with poor survival. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that high plasma sodium variability is a marker for increased mortality in severely burn-injured patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of adult burn patients with a burn injury of 15\% total body surface area (TBSA) or greater from 2010 to 2014. All patients included in the study had at least three serum sodium levels checked during admission. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine if hypernatremia, hyponatremia, or sodium variability independently increased the odds ratio (OR) for death. Results: Two hundred twelve patients met entry criteria. Mean age and \%TBSA for the study was 45 {\textpm} 18 years and 32 {\textpm} 19\%. Twenty-nine patients died for a mortality rate of 14\%.

While mean sodium was significantly higher for non-survivors (138 {\textpm} 3 milliequivalents/liter (meq/l)) than for survivors (135 {\textpm} 2 meq/l), mean sodium levels remained within the laboratory reference range (135 to 145 meq/l) for both groups.

  abstract = {Burst-suppression electroencephalography (EEG) patterns of electrical activity, characterized by intermittent high-power broad-spectrum oscillations alternating with isoelectricity, have long been observed in the human brain during general anesthesia, hypothermia, coma and early infantile encephalopathy. Recently, commonalities between conditions associated with burst-suppression patterns have led to new insights into the origin of burst-suppression EEG patterns, their effects on the brain, and their use as a therapeutic tool for protection against deleterious neural states. These insights have been further supported by advances in mechanistic modeling of burst suppression. In this Perspective, we review the origins of burst-suppression patterns and use recent insights to weigh evidence in the controversy regarding the extent to which burstsuppression patterns observed during profound anesthetic-induced brain inactivation are associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Whether the clinical intent is to avoid or maintain the brain in a state producing burst-suppression patterns, monitoring and controlling neural activity presents a technical challenge. We discuss recent advances that enable monitoring and control of burst suppression.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Changes in Doppler flow patterns of hepatic veins (HV), portal vein (PV) and intra-renal veins (RV) reflect right atrial pressure and venous congestion; the feasibility of obtaining these assessments and the clinical relevance of the findings is unknown in a general ICU population. This study compares the morphology of HV, PV and RV waveform abnormalities in prediction of major adverse kidney events at 30 days (MAKE30) in critically ill patients. Study design and methods:{\enspace} We conducted a prospective observational study enrolling adult patients within 24 h of admission to the ICU. Patients underwent an ultrasound evaluation of the HV, PV and RV. We compared the rate of MAKE-30 events in patients with and without venous flow abnormalities in the hepatic, portal and intra-renal veins. The HV was considered abnormal if S to D wave reversal was present. The PV was considered abnormal if the portal pulsatility index (PPI) was greater than 30\%. We also examined PPI as a continuous variable to assess whether small changes in portal vein flow was a clinically important marker of venous congestion. Results:{\enspace} From January 2019 to June 2019, we enrolled 114 patients. HV abnormalities demonstrate an odds ratio of 4.0 (95\% CI 1.4--11.2). PV as a dichotomous outcome is associated with an increased odds ratio of MAKE-30 but fails to reach statistical significance (OR 2.3 95\% CI 0.87--5.96), but when examined as a continuous variable it demonstrates an odds ratio of 1.03 (95\% CI 1.00--1.06). RV Doppler flow abnormalities are not associated with an increase in the rate of MAKE-30 Interpretation:{\enspace} Obtaining hepatic, portal and renal venous Doppler assessments in critically ill ICU patients are feasible. Abnormalities in hepatic and portal venous Doppler are associated with an increase in MAKE-30. Further research is needed to determine if venous Doppler assessments can be useful measures in assessing right-sided venous congestion in critically ill patients.},

Subsequently, CSW virtually vanished, only to reappear a quarter century later in the neurosurgical literature. A valid diagnosis of CSW requires evidence of inappropriate urinary salt losses and reduced "effective arterial blood volume." With no gold standard, the reported measures of volume depletion do not stand scrutiny. We cannot tell the difference between CSW and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Furthermore, the distinction does not make a difference; regardless of volume status, hyponatremia complicating intracranial disease should be treated with hypertonic saline.},

Methods:{\enspace} We obtained data from 14 neurotrauma ICUs in Europe, Australia and UK for severe TBI patients (GCS\,{$\leq$}\,8) requiring ICP monitoring. We identified patients who received any desmopressin and recorded daily dose, 6-hourly serum sodium, and 6-hourly ICP. Results:{\enspace} We studied 262 severe TBI patients. Of these, 39 patients (14.9\%) received desmopressin. Median length of treatment with desmopressin was 1 [1--3] day and daily intravenous dose varied between centres from 0.125 to 10 mcg. The median hourly rate of decrease in serum sodium was low (-\,0.1 [-\,0.2 to 0.0] mmol/L/h) with a median period of decrease of 36 h. The proportion of 6-h periods in which the rate of natremia correction exceeded 0.5 mmol/L/h or 1 mmol/L/h was low, at 8\% and 3\%, respectively, and ICPs remained stable.

Conclusions:{\enspace} In severe TBI, desmopressin administration, potentially representing instances of diabetes insipidus is common and is independently associated with increased mortality.

Methods:{\enspace} We obtained data from 14 neurotrauma ICUs in Europe, Australia and UK for severe TBI patients (GCS\,{$\leq$}\,8) requiring ICP monitoring. We identified patients who received any desmopressin and recorded daily dose, 6-hourly serum sodium, and 6-hourly ICP. Results:{\enspace} We studied 262 severe TBI patients. Of these, 39 patients (14.9\%) received desmopressin. Median length of treatment with desmopressin was 1 [1--3] day and daily intravenous dose varied between centres from 0.125 to 10 mcg. The median hourly rate of decrease in serum sodium was low (-\,0.1 [-\,0.2 to 0.0] mmol/L/h) with a median period of decrease of 36 h. The proportion of 6-h periods in which the rate of natremia correction exceeded 0.5 mmol/L/h or 1 mmol/L/h was low, at 8\% and 3\%, respectively, and ICPs remained stable. After adjusting for IMPACT score and injury severity score, desmopressin administration was independently associated with increased 60-day mortality [HR of 1.83 (1.05--3.24) (p\,=\,0.03)]. Conclusions:{\enspace} In severe TBI, desmopressin administration, potentially representing instances of diabetes insipidus is common and is independently associated with increased mortality. Desmopressin doses vary markedly among ICUs; however, the associated decrease in natremia rarely exceeds recommended rates and median ICP values remain unchanged. These findings support the notion that desmopressin therapy is safe.},

The etiology of possible causes of sodium disturbance is discussed in both the general inpatient and neurologic populations. Areas of importance are highlighted with regard to the differential diagnosis of sodium disturbance in neurologic patients and management strategies are discussed. Specific discussions of the etiology, diagnosis and management of cerebral salt wasting syndrome, the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion and central diabetes insipidus are presented, as well as the problems of over-treatment. The importance of diagnosis at an early stage of these diseases is stressed, with a recommendation for conservative management of milder cases.},

Few studies have evaluated the impact of hypernatremia on early mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) treated in a neurocritical care unit. METHODS{\enspace} A retrospective review of patients with severe TBI (admission Glasgow Coma Scale score {$\leq$} 8) treated in a single neurocritical care unit between 1986 and 2012 was performed. Patients with at least 3 serum sodium values were selected for the study. Patients with diabetes insipidus and those with hypernatremia on admission were excluded. The highest serum sodium level during the hospital stay was recorded, and hypernatremia was classified as none ({$\leq$} 150 mEq/L), mild (151--155 mEq/L), moderate (156--160 mEq/L), and severe ({$>$} 160 mEq/L). Multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to determine independent predictors of early mortality. RESULTS{\enspace} A total of 588 patients with severe TBI were studied.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND~           Complex spinal procedures are associated with intense pain in the postoperative period. Adequate peri-operative pain management has been shown to correlate with improved outcomes including early ambulation and early discharge.           OBJECTIVES~           We aimed to evaluate the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after complex spine surgery.           DESIGN AND DATA SOURCES~           A systematic review using the PROcedure SPECific postoperative pain managemenT methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews published in the English language from January 2008 to April 2020 assessing postoperative pain after complex spine surgery using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases.           RESULTS~           Out of 111 eligible studies identified, 31 randomised controlled trials and four systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria. Pre-operative and intra-operative interventions that improved postoperative pain were paracetamol, cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 specific-inhibitors or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intravenous ketamine infusion and regional analgesia techniques including epidural analgesia using local anaesthetics with or without opioids. Limited evidence was found for local wound infiltration, intrathecal and epidural opioids, erector spinae plane block, thoracolumbar interfascial plane block, intravenous lidocaine, dexmedetomidine and gabapentin.           CONCLUSIONS~           The analgesic regimen for complex spine surgery should include pre-operative or intra-operative paracetamol and COX-2 specific inhibitors or NSAIDs, continued postoperatively with opioids used as rescue analgesics. Other recommendations are intra-operative ketamine and epidural analgesia using local anaesthetics with or without opioids. Although there is procedure-specific evidence in favour of intra-operative methadone, it is not recommended as it was compared with shorter-acting opioids and due to its limited safety profile. Furthermore, the methadone studies did not use non-opioid analgesics, which should be the primary analgesics to ultimately reduce overall opioid requirements, including methadone. Further qualitative randomised controlled trials are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of these recommended analgesics on postoperative pain relief.},

  abstract = {Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder, affecting more than 15\% of patients in the hospital. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) is the most frequent cause of hypotonic hyponatremia, mediated by nonosmotic release of arginine vasopressin (AVP, previously known as antidiuretic hormone), which acts on the renal V2 receptors to promote water retention. There are a variety of underlying causes of SIAD, including malignancy, pulmonary pathology, and central nervous system pathology. In clinical practice, the etiology of hyponatremia is frequently multifactorial and the management approach may need to evolve during treatment of a single episode. It is therefore important to regularly reassess clinical status and biochemistry, while remaining alert to potential underlying etiological factors that may become more apparent during the course of treatment. In the absence of severe symptoms requiring urgent intervention, fluid restriction (FR) is widely endorsed as the first-line treatment for SIAD in current guidelines, but there is considerable controversy regarding second-line therapy in instances where FR is unsuccessful, which occurs in around half of cases. We review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and differential diagnosis of SIAD, and summarize recent evidence for therapeutic options beyond FR, with a focus on tolvaptan, urea, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors.},

The practice at the study center has been to use hypertonic saline (HTS) to generate a targeted serum sodium of 145 to 155 mEq/l in patients with TBI. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between serum sodium values and ICP, and to evaluate the acute effect of HTS on ICP. Methods: A retrospective review of patients who were admitted to the trauma ICU for TBI, had an ICP monitor placed, and received at least one dose of HTS between January 2006 and March 2011 was performed. Data were collected for up to 120 hours after ICP monitor placement. The primary outcome was the relationship between serum sodium and maximum ICP. Secondary outcomes were the relationship between serum sodium and the mean number of daily interventions for ICP control, and the acute effect of HTS on ICP during the 6 hours after each dose. Linear regression was used to analyze the primary outcome. Analysis of variance on ranks and repeated measures analysis of variance were used to evaluate the number of interventions and the acute effect of HTS on ICP, respectively. Results: Eighty-one patients were enrolled with mean {\textpm} standard deviation age of 36 {\textpm} 15 years and median Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7 (interquartile range, 4 to 7). A total of 1,230 serum sodium values (range, 118 to174 mEq/l) and 7,483 ICP values (range, 0 to 159 mmHg) were collected. There was no correlation between serum sodium and maximum ICP (R2 = 0.0052).

  abstract = {For 200 years, the 'closed box' analogy of intracranial pressure (ICP) has underpinned neurosurgery and neuro-critical care. Cushing conceptualised the Monro-Kellie doctrine stating that a change in blood, brain or CSF volume resulted in reciprocal changes in one or both of the other two. When not possible, attempts to increase a volume further increase ICP. On this doctrine's "truth or relative untruth" depends many of the critical procedures in the surgery of the central nervous system. However, each volume component may not deserve the equal weighting this static concept implies. The slow production of CSF (0.35\,ml/min) is dwarfed by the dynamic blood in and outflow ({$\sim$}700\,ml/min). Neuro-critical care practice focusing on arterial and ICP regulation has been questioned. Failure of venous efferent flow to precisely match arterial afferent flow will yield immediate and dramatic changes in intracranial blood volume and pressure. Interpreting ICP without interrogating its core drivers may be misleading. Multiple clinical conditions and the cerebral effects of altitude and microgravity relate to imbalances in this dynamic rather than ICP per se. This article reviews the Monro-Kellie doctrine, categorises venous outflow limitation conditions, relates physiological mechanisms to clinical conditions and suggests specific management options.},

The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for hyponatremia associated with TBI. We retrospectively analyzed the cases of TBI patients who were admitted to the emergency intensive care unit at Okayama University Hospital between October 2011 and September 2014. A total of 82 TBI patients were enrolled. The incidences of hyponatremia (serum sodium level of＜135mEq/L) and severe hyponatremia (serum sodium level of＜130mEq/L) within the first 14 days after admission were 51ｵ (n＝42) and 20ｵ (n＝16), respectively. After admission, hyponatremia took a median period of 7 days to develop and lasted for a median of 3 days. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that higher fluid intake from days 1 to 3 and the presence of cranial fractures were risk factors for hyponatremia. The 58 patients with hyponatremia experienced fewer ventilator-free days, longer intensive care unit stays, and less favorable outcomes compared to the 24 patients without hyponatremia; however, these differences were not significant. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal management strategy for TBI-associated hyponatremia in the intensive care unit setting.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} Monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is crucial in the management of the patient with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). In several institutions ICP and CPP are summarized hourly and entered manually on bedside charts; these data have been used in large observational and interventional trials. However, ICP and CPP may change rapidly and frequently, so data recorded in medical charts might underestimate actual ICP and CPP shifts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of manual data annotation for proper capturing of ICP and CPP.

Methods:{\enspace} One hundred patients were included. First, we compared the MR data with the values stored in the computerized system during the first 7 days after admission. For this point-to-point analysis, we calculated the difference between end-hour MR and HR ICP and CPP. Then we analyzed the burden of high ICP ({$>$}\,20 mm Hg) and low CPP ({$<$}\,60 mm Hg) measured by the computerized system, in which continuous data were stored, compared with the pressure--time dose based on end-hour measurements. Results:{\enspace} The mean difference between MR and HR end-hour values was 0.02 mm Hg for ICP (SD 3.86 mm Hg) and 1.54 mm Hg for CPP (SD 8.81 mm Hg). ICP\,{$>$}\,20 mm Hg and CPP\,{$<$}\,60 mm Hg were not detected by MR in 1.6\% and 5.8\% of synchronized measurements, respectively. Analysis of the pathological ICP and CPP throughout the recording, however, indicated that calculations based on manual recording seriously underestimated the ICP and CPP burden (in 42\% and 28\% of patients, respectively). Conclusions:{\enspace} Manual entries fairly represent end-hour HR ICP and CPP. However, compared with a computerized system, they may prove inadequate, with a serious risk of underestimation of the ICP and CPP burden.},

  abstract = {We aimed to assess the reliability and validity of the Therapy Intensity Level scale (TIL) for intracranial pressure (ICP) management. We reviewed the medical records of 31 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in two European intensive care units (ICUs). The ICP TIL was derived over a 4-day period for 4-h (TIL4) and 24-h epochs (TIL24). TIL scores were compared with historical schemes for TIL measurement, with each other, and with clinical variables. TIL24 scores in ICU patients with TBI were compared with two control groups: patients with extracranial trauma necessitating intensive care (Trauma\_ICU; n = 20) and patients with TBI not needing ICU care (TBI\_WARD; n = 19), to further determine the discriminative validity of the TIL for ICP-related ICU interventions. Interrater and intraobserver agreement were excellent for TIL4 and TIL24 (Cohen j: 0.98--0.99; intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.99--1; p {$<$} 0.0005). The mean + standard deviation (SD) TIL24 in the ICU TBI cohort was significantly higher than the Trauma\_ICU patients and the TBI\_WARD patients (8.2 -- 3.2 vs. 2.2 -- 0.9 and 0.1 -- 0.1, respectively; p {$<$} 0.005 for both comparisons). Correlations between the TIL scale scores and historical TIL scores, between TIL24 and the Glasgow Coma Scale, and between a range of TIL metrics and summary measures of ICP over the 4-day period, were all highly significant ( p {$<$} 0.01). The results were consistent with the expected direction. A linear mixed effect analysis, accounting for within-subjects repeated measures, showed strong correlation between TIL4 and 4-h ICP ( p {$<$} 0.0000005). The TIL scale is a reliable measurement instrument with a high degree of validity for assessing the therapeutic intensity level of ICP management in patients with TBI.},
